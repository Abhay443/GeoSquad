Problem statement: - We live in a country like India which is ranked as 2nd most populated Country.

And the majority of the people are still staying in rural areas as compared to urban areas.

So, because of this one of the major issue which India faces is "Basic Hygiene".

The reason is because people living in these remote areas are not aware of how important "hygiene" is for keeping oneself healthy. So, that is why, we can see that most of the people just defecate in open in bushes, fields. Live example could be, "Travelling in Local trains and seeing how kids just defecate nearby the railway track". Now, this problem could be also because people are not aware where the public toilets are built so that they don't have to defecate in open. There is very much of lack of awareness which is spread out among majority of the people in India (especially rural areas). Also, this "sanitation" problem is also faced mainly during Natural Disasters. People just can't find out where they can go to defecate. Especially Women find it most difficult during their monthly cycles. They can't even defecate in open in bushes also. And all this is the main reason why the Survey results in majority of Health issues in India.

Solution: -
So, the solution which we would like to provide through "HERE Toilet Finder" is providing the User with all the nearby Toilet options. This can avoid Users from simply travelling to locations searching for Toilets and also by avoiding them from defecating in open.
Adding to the above point, we can even add "LIVE RATING OPTION" wherein User who is using "HERE Toilet Finder" can update the situation of the Toilets (bad/Good/etc.). And this live data we can provide to other Users so that they can get up to date information about their nearby Sanitation facility.
Summary: -

So, I would conclude by saying that, "Sanitation promotion is one of the most important roles the health sector can have in environmental health planning, because behaviors must be changed to increase householders' demand for sustained use of sanitation, especially in rural areas where the pressure for change is lower".
I think "HERE Toilet Finder" can be a good alternative to combat this hygiene issue.
